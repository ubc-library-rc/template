# Land acknowledgement

Before beginning the workshop, we'd like to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located. The UBC Vancouver campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) peoples.

Please take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) so that you can visualize the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.
